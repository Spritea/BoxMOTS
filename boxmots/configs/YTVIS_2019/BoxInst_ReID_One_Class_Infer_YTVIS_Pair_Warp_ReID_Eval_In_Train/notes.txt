is based on:
configs/BDD_DATA/BoxInst_ReID_One_Class_Infer_BDD_Pair_Warp_ReID_Eval_In_Train/MS_R_50_1x_bdd_mots_coco_pretrain_strong_iter_21k_seq_shuffle_fl_2_lr_0_001_bs_4_eval_40_no_color_sim_pretrain_weights.yaml
2.must use the CondInst_ReID_One_Class_Infer_BDD_Pair_Warp_ReID_Eval_In_Train class,
because videos in YTVIS 2019 do not have the same resolution, which needs extra process.
The extra process has been done for BDD100k MOTS dataset,
since BDD100K MOTS dataset does not have the same resolution for all videos either.
3.train our model with optical flow with less iterations and smaller batch size,
because every 20 iters with bs=4 take about 1 min, much slower than the one without optical flow.
