1.Files in the folder my_code_for_add_noise_to_shadow_det is to
get mask trajectories with noisy shadow detection results.
2.In this folder, for mask trajectories, we only need to perform step 1,4,5 of StrongSORT folder,
since add noise to shadow det result does not influence box detections
and its DeepSORT data association results.
3.We copy the step 1,4,5 code to this place, to keep the StrongSORT folder clean.
